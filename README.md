# Foodinator - A Food Recommendation System

This repository contains the source code for Foodinator, a food recommendation system developed as part of the Technical Project Round for JTP (Japan Third Party).

## Introduction

This is a food recommendation system that recommends food based on the user's preferences. The system uses a K-Means clustering algorithm to cluster similar foods together and recommend foods based on the user's preferences.

It also supports direct food recommendation based on the user's food preferences by using cosine similarity. 

## Features

- Feature 1: Recommends food based on the user's preferences.
- Feature 2: Provides detailed information about the recommended food items.
- Feature 3: Takes into account the user's allergens and nutritional requirements.
- Feature 4: Supports direct search functionality for food recommendation based on the user's food preferences.

## Technologies Used

The system has been developed using the FastAPI framework for the backend and React for the frontend. The system uses MongoDB as the database to store the food items and user preferences. The system has been containerized using Docker to ensure easy deployment and scalability.
