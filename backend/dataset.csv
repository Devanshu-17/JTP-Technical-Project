Place the noodles in boiling water, and allow 8 to 9 minutes to cook. In a 12 to 14-inch saute pan, place the oil, anchovies, and onion over medium heat and cook.

Serve immediately.                          To make the dough: Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs and milk mixture. Using a fork, beat together the eggs and milk mixture and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the well.                          As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well shape. Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy. The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.                          Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands. Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up any leftover crusty bits. Discard these bits. Lightly flour the board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes. The dough should be elastic and a little sticky. Continue to knead for another 3 minutes, remembering to dust your board when necessary. Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.                          To shape the Bigoli: Knead dough until smooth and tight, and let rest 20 minutes. Note: Do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe. They are essential for a light pasta. Cut the dough into 6 pieces, and run each piece through a meat grinder set to the smallest extrusion size. As the pasta exits, cut it into 12-inch pieces and immediately dust with flour.

The same goes for the marinated skewers. Prepare and marinate the day before and just grill before the guests arrive.                                    For a challenge:                                        If you have access to a grill, then of course that adds to the flavor. Don't forget to soak nonlacquered skewers beforehand so that they don't catch fire.

Other things will get added to this base as we season each item.For the roasted peppers, quarter and core the pepper then put it right under a broiler with the skin side up, until it is completely charred on that side (it's okay if there's a little red still showing). Transfer the peppers into a plastic bag and seal it. The steam helps loosen the skins and when the peppers have cooled, you should be able to remove the skin with no difficulty. Once you've peeled them, put them back in the bag and drizzle enough olive oil on them to coat, then toss them with the oregano salt and pepper. This can be made in advanceFor the potatoes, boil them in well salted water until you can just barely pass a fork through them (they should still be a little firm). Remove them from the water and allow them to cool enough to handle. Slice them into cubes then toss them with 3 Tbs of dressing and parsley. Add salt and pepper as needed and set aside. This can be made in advanceFor the haricots vert, return the potato water to a boil and add more salt (it should taste like the ocean). Prepare an ice bath by filling a bowl with water and ice cubes. Add the haricots vert and boil until they're bright green and tender, but they still have a bit of crunch (a minute or two, longer if you're using older beans). Drain and put them into the ice bath to ""shock"" them, this should make them turn a very vibrant green color. You don't want to dress these too early since the vinegar will make them discolor. If you're doing this in advance, wrap them and refrigerate until you're ready to serve them.For the tomatoes, toss them with the onions and capers along with a little olive oil, salt and pepper.To assemble the salad, add the oregano and thyme to the master dressing and toss the whole lettuce leaves in enough dressing to coat each leaf.

Add half of the fennel fronds and all of the parsley to the crumbs and pulse a fewtimes to combine them well. Set aside. Soak the raisins in the Pernod for 30 minutes to 1 hour (or warm water if youprefer to not use Pernod) in a small bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap andset it aside in a warm spot.

Scoop up the paste with the knife, form it into ablob, and repeat the smearing and scraping until you have a smooth paste. Heat a small saut pan over medium heat for 1 minute. Add the pine nuts to thedry pan and toast, tossing often (or else theyll burn!), just until they begin torelease their aroma and color slightly, about 3 minutes. Spill them onto a plate tocool.

Cut the top off the tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil, season with sea salt and black pepper, top with a sprinkling of bread crumbs, and drizzle with olive oil (again).Put on a Silpat sheet or piece of aluminum foil on a baking sheet. Bake for 30-45 minutes or until the tomato has started to collapse.Caesar SaladYield: 4 servingsTime: 30 minutesIngredients1 garlic clove, skin off1/4 teaspoon sea salt4 anchovies1 egg, farmers' market fresh1/4 teaspoon Worcester sauce2-3 drops of Tabasco, optional2 hearts of romaine3-4 tablespoons olive oil depending on taste1 teaspoon lemon juice, freshly squeezed1/4 cup Parmesan or Romano cheese, freshly grated1/2 cup croutonsBlack pepperMethodUse a wooden bowl if you have one. Sprinkle the sea salt on a wooden cutting board. Mash the garlic back and forth on the salt with the flat side of a chef's knife, then sweep the garlic-salt mash into the salad bowl.Boil water in a small saucepan. Add the egg and cook for 4 minutes. Remove the egg, let cool, then open, scoop out the yolk and white with a small spoon, and add to the salad bowl along with the Worcester sauce, Tabasco (optional), olive oil, and lemon juice.With a fork, mash the anchovies into pieces against the side of the salad bowl and dissolve them in the dressing. Mix well.Tear the romaine leaves into pieces, add to the salad bowl, top with the grated cheese, croutons, and season with the pepper. Toss to coat the leaves. Taste and adjust the flavors by adding more lemon juice or sea salt.Sauteed Shrimp with Shiitake MushroomsYield: 4 servingsTime: 15 minutesIngredients1 pound shrimp, washed, shelled, deveined1/2 pound shiitake or brown mushrooms, washed, ends trimmed, sliced thin2 garlic cloves, peeled, finely chopped2 shallots, peeled, finely chopped2 teaspoons sweet butterOlive oilSea salt and pepperMethodHeat a frying pan, drizzle with olive oil, season with sea salt and pepper, add the shrimp and 1 teaspoon of the butter. Cook until pink and lightly browned on both sides, 5-6 minutes total. Remove from the pan.Drizzle olive oil into the same pan, add the mushrooms, garlic, and shallots. Saute until lightly browned, add the other teaspoon of butter. Season with salt and pepper. Move the mushrooms to one side and return the shrimp to the pan to reheat.Serve either mixed together or separated on the plate.Grilled SteakYield: 1 servingTime: 15 minutesIngredients1 10 oz. steak, T-Bone, Porterhouse, Rib Eye with the Bone-in, washed, pat dryOlive oilSea salt and black pepperMethodPreheat the grill or broiler.

353,Quick tomato macaroni cheese,https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/683-556x370.jpg,"MethodI think this is the best macaroni cheese recipe ever (even though it's a bit naughty)!  I've used sweet tomatoes in my recipe as they really complement the cheese, and instead of bchamel sauce I've used single cream as it's a lot lighter. I've also topped the dish off with cheesy breadcrumbs, which give it a wonderful crunch. I think you'll laugh when you see how easy it is to make. I put it together extremely quickly by using my Magimix food processor. Don't worry if you haven't got one  you can chop it all up by hand instead and then mix it in a bowl.Preheat your oven to 200C/400F/gas 6. Get a pan of salted boiling water going and cook your macaroni according to the packet instructions. Meanwhile, break your bread up, place it in the food processor and whiz it up to form breadcrumbs. Set aside. Wash your tomatoes and place them in the food processor with the garlic, basil, sun-dried tomatoes, anchovies and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Whiz up for 30 seconds. Then add 2 handfuls of the Parmesan, the cream, vinegar and grated nutmeg. Whiz until smooth and season carefully to taste so it's really yummy!By this time your macaroni will probably be cooked, so drain it in a colander, saving some of the cooking water. Place the pasta back into the pan and pour over every last bit of the cheesy sauce. You want it to be quite loose because you'll be surprised how quickly the sauce will disappear inside the macaroni and will look dry. So add a few spoonfuls of the reserved cooking water. Now you need to get yourself a baking dish about 810cm deep  this could be an earthenware dish or even a shallow ovenproof pan. Pour the pasta straight into your baking dish and break the mozzarella into little pieces over the top. Mix the last handful of Parmesan with the thyme leaves and breadcrumbs and sprinkle evenly over the top of the dish. Drizzle generously with good extra virgin olive oil  this will give you a lovely crunch topping.Place in the preheated oven for 2025 minutes or until piping hot and golden on top. Serve straight away, sprinkled with a little extra Parmesan. Best eaten with a nice salad  and you'll love it.Tip",Non-Veg,4621.1,0.1,1.5,False,False,http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/pasta-recipes/quick-tomato-macaroni-cheese,"['anchovies', 'anchovies', 'pepper', 'bread', 'extra', 'virgin', 'olive', 'oil', 'basil', 'basil', 'thyme', 'garlic', 'macaroni', 'macaroni', 'nutmeg', 'parmesan', 'cheese', 'red', 'wine', 'vinegar', 'sea', 'salt', 'single', 'cream', 'cow', 's', 'milk', 'mozzarella', 'sun', 'dried', 'tomatoes', 'super', 'ripe', 'tomatoes']",3

358,"Tamarind Glazed Swordfish with Lime, Cilantro and Tamarind Sauce",https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/695-556x370.jpg,"BEGIN TO MAKE THE GLAZE:  Soften one of the cubes of tamarind paste in a small bowl with about two tablespoons of very hot water.  Let it sit, stirring occasionally, while you prepare the sauce for the fish.                                  MAKE THE CILANTRO TAMARIND PASTE:  Put the cilantro, garlic, tamarind, 2 tablespoons plus one teaspoon of soy sauce, the onion, shallots, anchovies or anchovy paste, and the juice of half of one lime into your food processor.  Pull the tamarind apart into small pieces before putting into the food processor, to make sure there are no hard seeds in it. If you want heat, add a fresh chili that has been coarsely chopped.                                  Process for about ten seconds, scrape down, process again, scrape down and, if necessary, process a third time.  You want the pieces to be small and the mixture well combined, but you do not want a liquidy puree.                                    Heat the vegetable oil in a small, heavy saucepan with a lid.  Before it starts to smoke, add the onion, cilantro and tamarind mixture and stir well.  Simmer for about ten minutes, stirring occasionally.  Put the lid on and set aside.  It will hold, unrefrigerated, for a few hours.                                  PREPARE THE FISH:  Fire up your grill to medium heat or preheat your oven on the broiler setting.  If broiling, put some foil down on the pan.  Pat dry the swordfish steaks and sprinkle well with salt.  Rub in the olive oil.  Juice another half lime and set aside.                                  FINISH MAKING THE GLAZE:  Press the tamarind pulp through a fine strainer.  Add the juice of half a lime and a teaspoon of soy sauce.  Juice the other half lime and set aside.                                  TOAST THE PUMPKIN SEEDS, IF USING:  Preheat the oven to about 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Toast the pumpkin seeds on a baking sheet lined with parchment, on the top shelf of your oven, turning once, for about five minutes, or until lightly browned. Remove from the oven and toss in a bowl with 1 teaspoon of soy sauce or more to taste.  Put back in the oven on the parchment-lined pan for 2 - 3 minutes. Remove and set aside.                                   COOK THE FISH:  When the grill or broiler is hot - you want your coals to be white -- cook the fish on one side for 3 -5 minutes minutes, depending on the thickness of the steaks and on how well you like your swordfish cooked.                                    While the fish is grilling, bring the sauce to a good simmer over medium heat.  Add the rice wine and cook for a minute or two. (When I broil, I don't pierce the foil, so that I can collect the juices, which I then strain and add to the sauce at this point.)  Taste the sauce and add more lime juice -- or a pinch of sugar if it's too tart -- and salt, to taste.                                  Flip the fish over and baste with the tamarind glaze.  Cook the second side, then flip once more and baste again, cooking only for about ten or fifteen seconds.                                  Serve with the sauce.

Saut the garlic in the uncovered pan until it becomes colored a pale gold.                                                     Add the chicken pieces and turn up the heat to high. Brown the chicken well on all sides, starting with the skin side facing the bottom of the pan to melt its fat. Sprinkle with a little salt and generous grindings of pepper. When you have browned the chicken well all over, turn down the heat to medium, remove the garlic, add the white wine and the vinegar, and cover the pan.                                                     When the liquid in the pan has evaporated by half, put in the chopped anchovies and the chopped half of the olives, turn the chicken pieces over, cover the pan, and continue cooking. Cook until the chicken is done through and through and feels very tender when pricked with a fork.                                                     Tilt the pan, pushing the chicken to one side to let the juices collect at the other end. Spoon off and discard most of the clear fat, but none of the brown cooking juices. Add the olive pieces, the parsley, and the basil and cook for 1 or 2 minutes longer, turning the chicken over once or twice.                                                     Add the lemon juice, turn the chicken pieces over, and transfer at once to a warm serving platter together with all the cooking juices in the pan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                var articleType_27_data = {};                    articleType_27_data.init_step_by_step_images = 0;",Non-Veg,143.0,7.2,1.9,True,True,http://www.cookstr.com/recipes/fricasseed-chicken-with-black-olives,"['anchovy', 'anchovy', 'basil', 'basil', 'bell', 'pepper', 'chicken', 'garlic', 'lemon', 'juice', 'olives', 'parsley', 'salt', 'vegetable', 'oil', 'vinegar', 'white', 'wine']",0

With a sharp knife, slicing thinly across the grain, cut 8 equal slices, each about 1 ounce. Lightly oil two sheets of parchment or wax paper (we use the 9-inch parchment circles sold in pastry supply shops). Place 2 slices of beef side by side on one of the oiled sheets. Lay the second sheet, oiled side down, over the beef. With a heavy mallet, pound down and toward you, letting the weight of the mallet flatten the meat. Rotate the parchment and continue pounding gently. As the meat gets thinner, use lighter strokes to avoid tearing or pounding too thin. Flatten enough to form a 9-inch circle. Hold the package up to the light to make sure the meat is uniformly thin.                                                    Repeat to make the remaining 3 portions.

Invert the carpaccio portions onto four chilled 9-inch plates, and carefully peel back the remaining paper sheets. Lightly season each portion with a pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Cut the anchovy fillets in half lengthwise and arrange 4 or 5 pieces randomly over the meat. Sprinkle with the capers and parsley. Use a vegetable peeler to shave large curls of Parmesan cheese over each serving. Finish with a good drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. Serve with lemon wedges.                                                    Other garnish options: Omit the Parmesan, and sauce with strong Dijon mustard, either plain or thinned with crme frache.

402,Grilled Branzino With Rosemary Vinaigrette,https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/861-556x370.jpg,"1 Make the rosemary vinaigrette. Put the minced onion, mustard, salt, vinegar, garlic and rosemary into a blender and pure it for about 30 seconds. Use a spatula to scrape down the sides of the blender and puree it again for 10-20 seconds. Scrape the sides down again. Turn the blender on low and take the removable cap off the lid. Hold you hand over the hole, as it might spit a little. Pour the olive oil in slowly and put the cap back on. Turn the blender off and scrape the sides down one more time. Turn the blender back on low, then high for 60 seconds.Incidentally, this vinaigrette would be great with potatoes, chicken or turkey  or just over a tossed salad.2 Rinse the fish under cold water. Now make sure its gills and scales are all removed; your fishmonger is not always so diligent about this task, and no one wants a scale on his plate. Gills can impart a bitter taste to the fish, so they need to go, too.3 Use a very sharp knife and make several slashes on the sides of the fish, maybe every inch or so. Make the cuts at an angle to the side of the fish, and slice down until you feel the spine. Do not sever the spine, however. These cuts will help the fish cook faster. Rub olive oil all over the fish and set it aside.4 Prepare your grill for high, direct heat. Scrape down the grates well and close the lid. Salt the fish well. Now grab a paper towel, a set of tongs, and some cheap vegetable oil. Bring all of this out to the grill. Fold the paper towel over several times, moisten it with the vegetable oil, and hold it with tongs to wipe down the grill grates.5 Lay the fish down on the grill and close the lid. Let this cook for 5 minutes without touching it.6 Open the lid and, using tongs, gently see if you can lift the fish off the grates cleanly. Dont actually do this, but check for sticky spots. If you have some, get a metal spatula. Use the spatula to dislodge the fish from the sticky spots.Using tongs in one hand, and the spatula in another, gently flip the fish over. If it sticks, no biggie. It happens sometimes.7 Once the fish has been flipped, let it cook another 3-5 minutes. Again, test for sticky spots with the tongs and spatula. Dislodge them gently and gently lift the fish onto a plate. If the fish is too long or seems like it might break in half, use two metal spatulas instead of the tongs-and-spatula set-up.Drizzle the vinaigrette over the fish and serve at once. Goes well with crusty bread and a glass of pilsner beer or white wine.",Non-Veg,1125.1,52.4,12.0,True,True,http://simplyrecipes.com/recipes/grilled_branzino_with_rosemary_vinaigrette/,"['branzino', 'dijon', 'mustard', 'rosemary', 'rosemary', 'garlic', 'clove', 'mustard', 'olive', 'oil', 'olive', 'oil', 'onion', 'salt', 'salt', 'white', 'wine', 'vinegar']",0

Fold it in half so its double thickness, then fold it in half again. You should end up with what looks like a big, foil birthday card. Make two of these then lay them opened and flat on your table. Each foil wrap will hold one piece of fish  you can do a big one for four or a slightly smaller version for two.In a pestle and mortar, bash your lime leaves until they break down and all the flavour comes out. Then add the lemon grass and do the same again. Do this for a couple of minutes... its worth every second. Then add the garlic, chilli, grated ginger and all of the coriander stalks. Once this is all smashed to a pulp, add the soy sauce, the lime zest and juice and the olive old. Mix well, then taste and correct the seasoning with extra soy sauce as you see fit.Lightly score the sea bass on the skin side with a sharp knife and then rub them with the lime-ginger-lemon grass mix. Allow to marinate for an hour, if you have time, or you can cook it all straight away.Lightly brush the foil edges with a little beaten egg white  this helps to seal the parcel when you fold it up and keeps all the flavoured steam inside to cook the fish.Put the portions of sea bass, skin-side up on one side of each envelope. Divide the marinade and all the juice between the two packages and tuck some coriander into the slits of each piece of fish. Fold over the foil, then fold up two sides of the envelopes securely. Just before you seal the final side of the foil bags, divide the sake between the two envelopes, taking care so that it doesnt dribble out. Pucker and bend the folded sides up so that the juices cant cook out. Dont fold the foil right up to the edge of the fish  leave about 2 inches (5 cm) of space all round the fillets to let the steam circulate.I know all this sounds like a bit of a palaver, but its actually dead simple.Place straight on to the hot tray and cook for about 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Once cooked, allow to sit for 23 minutes. Serve the bags at the table  just cut them open and carefully lift out the fish. You can spoon the juices over it (but dont eat the bits from the marinade as theyre really only there for flavour).I like to serve this with a bowl of coriander-flavoured rice or noodles, cooked simply.

Add the garlic and cook until light golden brown, about 1 minute. Add the fish pieces and saute, stirring constantly, 8 to 9 minutes, until the fish is just cooked through.

Season, to taste, with salt and pepper and set aside.                          To make the pasta, make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs and oil. Using a fork, beat together the eggs and oil, and begin to incorporate the flour, starting with the inner rim of the well.                          As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up, retaining the well shape. Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy.

Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up and leftover crusty bits. Discard these bits. Lightly flour the board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes. The dough should be elastic and a little sticky. Continue to knead it for another 3 minutes, remembering to dust your board when necessary. Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.                          Roll out pasta to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine and place on a lightly floured surface. 1) If you have a ravioli-cutting rolling pin, cover the layer of pasta with a 1/4-inch thick layer of the sea bass mixture. Place an equal sheet of pasta over and press down lightly with your hands. Carefully roll the 2 sheets together with the roller to form the ravioli. Using a pastry cutter, cut the ravioli apart by running down between the ravioli. 2) If you do not have a ravioli-cutting rolling pin, then cut a single sheet of pasta at a time into rectangles 2 inches by 1-inch. Place a teaspoon of the fish mixture into the center of each rectangle and fold the pasta down like a piece of notebook paper and seal to form a 1-inch square. Repeat until all ingredients have been used.                          Bring 8 quarts of water to boil and add 3 tablespoons salt. Drop the ravioli in and cook 6 to 7 minutes, until tender and fully cooked. Meanwhile, in a 12 to 14-inch saute pan, combine tomato sauce, remaining 2 tablespoons oil and marjoram leaves, and place over heat. Drain the ravioli, reserving cooking water, and add ravioli to the pan with tomato sauce. Toss the pasta to dress it with the sauce, adjust the moisture of the sauce with pasta water, if necessary, and serve immediately.                          In a 3-quart saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, and cook until soft and light golden brown, about 8 to 10 minutes. Add the thyme and carrot, and cook 5 minutes more, until the carrot is quite soft. Add the tomatoes and juice and bring to a boil, stirring often. Lower the heat and simmer for 30 minutes until as thick as hot cereal. Season with salt and serve.

Rinse the fish inside and out with cold water and pat dry. With a thin sharp knife, make three diagonal cuts about  inch deep and about 1 inch apart on each side of the fish. Season the fish inside and out with salt and the cayenne pepper and fill the cavity with the chopped fennel fronds.

Place an 18-by-26-inch sheet of heavy-duty foil or parchment paper on a work surface. Rub the remaining  teaspoon butter over the foil, leaving a 2-inch border all around. Turn up the edges of the papillote slightly to hold the liquid you will be adding.                                                    Spread half the leek and fennel slices on the foil to make a bed for the fish and dot with about half of the seasoned butter. Set the fish on top and scatter the remaining vegetables over it. Dot with the remaining seasoned butter, and drizzle with the wine.                                                    Seal the papillote by folding the foil in half over the fish.

When the oil is warm, add the sliced onion and fennel to the pot, and season with salt and pepper.  Allow the vegetables to sweat for 2 minutes, and then add in the sliced garlic.  Cook the vegetables for another 3 minutes.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Next, add in the can of drained petite diced tomatoes and the white wine.

When the stock comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and allow the stock to simmer uncovered for 10 minutes.  It is this part of the process from which ""bouillabaisse"" gets its name: the first part of the word means ""to boil,"" and the second, ""to lower.""  The saffron will bloom in the simmering liquid, and will steep like tea in the stock, causing it to turn its trademark marigold color.  Season again lightly with salt and pepper.                                                                                                                            4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 After 10 minutes have passed, add in the rock shrimp and the mussels, and stir them around in the bouillabaisse broth.  They should take no more than 3 minutes to cook; the shrimp will turn from grey to coral in color, and the mussels will open.                                                                                                                              5                                                                            While the stock is simmering, cook the sea bass.  Begin by seasoning the sea bass well with salt and pepper on both sides.  Then cover the bottom of a large nonstick sauté pan with olive oil—a typical pan will require about 2 tablespoons.  Heat the oil on medium-high heat, and when the oil starts to shimmer, add the four filets of fish.  Cook for about 3-4 minutes per side, until golden.                                                                                                                            6                                                                            Rouille with Baguette Toasts: To toast the baguette, arrange the slices in a single layer on a baking sheet, and run into a 350-degree oven until dry and golden, about 10 minutes, but keep an eye on them!                                                                                                                            7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 For the rouille, combine the mayonnaise, garlic, lemon juice and zest, and roasted red pepper in a mini food processor, and season with salt and pepper.

Set aside. Strain and reserve the cooking broth.2 Prepare the cooked crab:Remove the crab legs from the body and use a nut cracker to crack the shells so that the meat can be easily removed once it is served (leave the meat in the shell). Break the body in half, and then cut each half again into either halves or thirds. You can opt to keep the crab meat in the body segments and serve it that way (more work for the eater) or you can pick out the crab meat from the body segments. If you pick out the crab meat, try to keep it in big chunks. Keep the top shell of the crab for making stock.Note you can use prepared fish or shellfish stock, or you can make your own. If you are not making your own stock, you can discard the crab top shell body. If prepared shellfish stock is not available, I would combine some prepared fish stock (available at many markets, including Trader Joe's) with clam juice.3 Prepare the shrimp: Split the shrimp shells down the back and remove the black vein. (See how to peel and devein shrimp.) I found the easiest way to do this, without removing the shell, is to lay the shrimp on its side and insert a small knife into the large end of the shrimp, with the blade pointing outward from the back (away from the shrimp and your hands). Once you have split the shrimp shells, you can turn the knife toward the shrimp, and cut in a little to find the black vein. Pull out the vein as much as you can. You can probably also use a pair of kitchen scissors to cut the backs of the shrimp.Alternatively, you can shell the shrimps and devein them. Shell-on imparts more flavor; shell-off is easier to eat. 4 Make the soup base: In a deep 8-quart covered pot, saut onions and bell pepper on medium heat in olive oil until soft. Add the garlic, saut 1 minute more. Add tomatoes, broth from the mollusks, red wine, tomato juice, fish or shellfish stock, the herb bouquet, and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Remove herb bouquet. Taste and correct seasoning.5 Add fish and shellfish: Add the fish and cook, covered, until the fish is just cooked through, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add the steamed mollusks, crabmeat, and shrimp. Heat just until shrimp are cooked (just 2-3 minutes, until they are bright pink). Do not overcook.6 Serve: Serve in large bowls, shells included. Sprinkle with minced parsley. Serve with crusty French or Italian bread and a robust red wine.

599,Seabass Ravioli from Ischia---Ravioli All' Ischitana,https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/1244-556x370.jpeg,"To make the pasta: make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs and oil. Using a fork, beat together the eggs and oil and begin to incorporate the flour, starting with the inner rim of the well.                          As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well shape. Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy. The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.                          Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands. Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up and leftover crusty bits. Discard these bits. Lightly flour the board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes. The dough should be elastic and a little sticky. Continue to knead it for another 3 minutes, remembering to dust your board when necessary. Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.                          While the dough rests, in a 12 to 14-inch saute pan, heat 4 tablespoons oil until smoking. Add the garlic and cook until light golden brown, about 1 minute. Add the fish pieces and saute, stirring constantly, 8 to 9 minutes, until the fish is just cooked through. Remove fish to a mixing bowl and allow to cool. To the mixing bowl, add the 3 tablespoons chopped marjoram, mashed potato and 6 tablespoons oil and stir to mix well, being certain to break up all of the fish. Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside.                          Roll out pasta to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine and place on a lightly floured surface.                          If you have a ravioli-cutting rolling pin, cover the layer of pasta with a 1/4-inch thick layer of the sea bass mixture. Place an equal sheet of pasta over and press down lightly with your hands. Carefully roll the 2 sheets together with the roller to form the ravioli. Using a pastry cutter, cut the ravioli apart by running down between the ravioli.                          If you do not have a ravioli-cutting rolling pin, then cut a single sheet of pasta at a time into rectangles 2 by 1-inch. Place 1 teaspoon of the fish mixture into the center of each rectangle and fold the pasta down like a piece of notebook paper and seal to form a 1-inch square. Repeat until all ingredients have been used.                          Bring 8 quarts of water to boil and add 3 tablespoons salt. Drop the ravioli in and cook 6 to 7 minutes, until tender and fully cooked. Meanwhile, in a 12 to 14-inch saute pan, combine tomato sauce, remaining oil and marjoram leaves and place over heat. Drain the ravioli, reserving cooking water, and add ravioli to the pan with tomato sauce. Toss the pasta to dress it with the sauce, adjust the moisture of the sauce with pasta water, if necessary, and serve immediately.                          In a 3-quart saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until soft and light golden brown, about 8 to 10 minutes.

(To check the oil temperature, use a deep-fry thermometer, or add a cube of bread to the oil, which should bubble immediately.)    Meanwhile, prepare the batter: Mix the flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl and stir in the beer until smooth. Gently fold in the beaten egg whites.    Season the fish with salt. To cook the fish, work in batches of about three or four pieces at a time. Using kitchen tongs, dip each piece in the batter, let any excess drain off, carefully submerge the fish in the hot oil, and fry until golden brown and cooked through, about 5 minutes.

Put the dried chiles, shallots, and garlic on separate sheets of foil, drizzle each with a little vegetable oil, and wrap each into a separate packet. Roast the three packets on a baking sheet until the contents of each is soft and golden: the chiles should take about 15 minutes, the garlic about 25 minutes, and the shallots about 35 minutes. When the chiles and shallots are cool enough to handle, chop each coarsely. Put them in a small food processor or mortar and pestle along with the roasted garlic, bonito flakes or smoked fish, palm or brown sugar, fish sauce, and tamarind juice or cherry juice concentrate. Blend or pound until smooth.    Prepare the coconut:    If youre using fresh coconut, bake the whole coconut at 375F for about 15 minutes. Set it aside to cool. Put the coconut on a hard surface; hit it hard with a hammer to split it in half, taking care to catch the juice, which you can save for drinking. With a sharp, thick knife, carefully dislodge the meat from the husk; wear a kitchen mitt to protect your hands. Peel the hard, dark, outer layer off the white meat. Cut the coconut flesh into small chunks; pulse in a food processor into small flakes. Toast the flakes in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until lightly golden, stirring frequently to prevent burning; let cool. Set aside 1/4 cup for the recipe and store the rest of the coconut flakes in a sealed jar; theyll keep for several weeks.                                Prepare the salad:    In a small skillet over high heat, heat the vegetable oil and add the sliced shallots and salt, stirring constantly to prevent burning. Fry the shallots until crisped and golden, about 2 minutes; drain them on paper towels. Arrange the pomelo sections on a serving platter; top with the cooked shrimp. Toss gently with the dressing, taking care not to bruise the fruit. Garnish with 1/4 cup toasted coconut flakes, the roasted peanuts, fried shallots, fresh chiles, and lime leaves or zest.

Sprinkle with the coconut flakes, lime leaves or zest, and orange zest. Put the dried chile powder in a tiny sauce bowl at one end of the platter. Arrange lime wedges all around.                Arrange the main salad ingredients in alternating piles.                    Sprinkle with the coconut flakes, lime leaves, or zest, and orange zest.        To serve, present the platter and then pour the dressing all over the ingredients on the platter. Sprinkle with the amount of chile powder you desire, reserving some for those who want more. Squeeze the lime wedges over all. Toss thoroughly and serve.

No time at all.I recalled a similar email from a year back about cooking skate with caper brown butter, and with her advice, the fish turned out perfectly. Without hesitation, I planned Pan-Fried Trout with Pecans for my next meal. To round it out in my mothers style, I made a quick saut of arugula, one of her favorite leafy greens, with a little lemon juice, and some cannelloni beans for more protein. The fish was delicious, a product of the accurate (if a bit stream-of-consciousness) instructions, which for the purpose of my recipe, have been re-written in complete sentences.Whenever I am home and eating my mothers cooking, I am always happy when the plate Im served is familiar, a product of all her old tricks. Not that I dont love the occasional escarole leaf stuffed with rice, but I prefer it when she leaves the experimenting to me. Sometimes the new method she recommends requires more instruction than at others. But with or without an email as impetus, it feels natural to improvise with my mother in mind, using her techniques, practices, and tastes to create plates that seem familiar, experimental, and all at once new again in my kitchen.From my kitchen, wishing my mother a happy birthday, to yours,Phoebe, THE QUARTER-LIFE COOK**Recipes**Pan-Fried Trout with PecansMakes 2 servingsMake friends with your fish monger and have him prepare the butterflied trout from the whole fish.

Make the cilantro butter by combining butter, minced cilantro and rum. Place mixture on plastic wrap, and form into 1 1/2-inch thick log. Place in refrigerator to set.                                  Supreme the oranges by slicing off the peel and pith in strips, then removing each section of citrus by slicing between the membranes.

Then remove the bone structure from the fish by carefully lifting up on the tail towards the head, exposing the bottom fillet. Turn this fillet over, skin side up, to serve.                                  Slice cilantro butter into discs, and place 1-2 discs on each fillet on the flesh side.

* olive oil
* onions
* Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Steps:

1. Start by caramelizing the onions. Thinly slice 2-3 onions and cook them in a large skillet over medium heat with 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are deeply caramelized, which should take about 30-40 minutes. If the onions start to stick to the pan, you can add a splash of water to deglaze the pan.

3. Toast the garlic for the toasted garlic breadcrumbs. Slice the day-old bread into small cubes and pulse in a food processor until you have coarse breadcrumbs. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat, then add 2-3 cloves of minced garlic. Cook until fragrant, then add the breadcrumbs and cook until crispy and golden brown. Season with salt and set aside.

4. Once the onions are caramelized, add the anchovies to the skillet and cook until they melt into the onions. Add 1-2 teaspoons of red-pepper flakes and cook for another minute until fragrant.

5. Add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet with the onion-anchovy mixture. Add a couple of tablespoons of butter and a generous grating of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Toss until the spaghetti is well coated. If the pasta looks dry, add some of the reserved pasta water.

- 2 oil-packed anchovy fillets
- 1 garlic clove
- 3 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1/2 cup olive oil

- 1/2 cup mayonnaise

Instructions:

1. Start by preparing your ingredients. Peel and mince the garlic clove.

* 1 tablespoon sea salt
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 2 tablespoons myeolchi aegjeot (fermented anchovy sauce) or vegan fish sauce for vegan-friendly version
* Lots of extra virgin olive oil (evoo)

Instructions:

1. Prepare the ramps by separating the leafy green parts from the white and light green parts. Slice the white and light green parts of the ramps into 1-inch pieces, and chop the leafy green parts roughly.

Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are just softened, about 3-5 minutes. Remove the skillet from heat and set aside to cool.
5. Assembly: In the large bowl with the fennel and parsley mixture, add the cooled potatoes and cooked vegetables. Drizzle the reserved vinaigrette over the vegetables, and toss everything together until well coated. Season the salad with coarse salt and ground pepper to taste.

Ingredients:

* Basa fish fillet
* Corn starch
* Ginger
* Oil
* Oyster sauce
* Pepper powder
* Salt
* Scallion
* Sesame oil
* Shaoxing wine
* Soy sauce
* Sugar
* Water

Instructions:

1. First, prepare the fish by patting it dry with a paper towel. This will help the fish to cook evenly and prevent it from becoming soggy.

2. Next, cut the fish into bite-sized pieces and set it aside.

3. Now, prepare the marinade for the fish. In a small bowl, mix together the soy sauce, shaoxing wine, sesame oil, sugar, and a pinch of pepper powder. Stir until the sugar has dissolved.

4. Place the fish in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over it. Make sure all of the fish is coated in the marinade. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (or up to 2 hours) to allow the flavors to meld.

5. While the fish is marinating, prepare the ginger and scallion. Peel and finely chop the ginger, and slice the scallion into thin rounds.

6. When you're ready to cook the fish, heat a few tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan or wok over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the ginger and scallion and cook for 30 seconds, or until fragrant.

7. Using a slotted spoon, remove the fish from the marinade and add it to the pan with the ginger and scallion. Cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until the fish is cooked through and has a crispy exterior.

8. While the fish is cooking, mix together a slurry of cornstarch and water. This will help to thicken the sauce and give it a glossy finish.

9. Once the fish is cooked, pour the remaining marinade over it and bring to a boil. Gradually add the cornstarch slurry, stirring constantly, until the sauce has thickened to your desired consistency.

10. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed, adding more soy sauce or sugar if desired.

1. Prepare the ingredients:
   * Clean and cut the meaty fish into small pieces, about 1-1.5 inches in size.
   * Wash and finely chop the shallots, ginger, garlic, serrano chiles, and plum tomato.
   * Measure out the spices: ground coriander, ground cumin, turmeric, and salt.
   * Pick and tear curry leaves into small pieces if they're not already torn.

2. Heat vegetable oil in a wide pan or clay pot over medium heat. When it's hot, add the chopped shallots, ginger, garlic, and serrano chiles. Sauté until the onions become translucent and the garlic and ginger become fragrant.

3. Add the ground coriander, ground cumin, and turmeric to the pan. Sauté the spices for a few seconds until they release their aroma. Be careful not to burn them.

4. Pour the finely chopped plum tomato into the pan. Cook the tomato until it turns soft and breaks down, releasing its juices - about 3-4 minutes.

5. Pour 1 cup of coconut milk (from the top of the can or box) into the pan, mixing gently to incorporate the spices and onions. Bring the mixture to a low simmer.

6. Gently place the fish pieces into the pan, nestling them into the sauce. Allow the curry to cook for about 3-5 minutes, occasionally spooning the sauce over the fish.

7. Once the fish has mostly cooked through, add about half of the remaining coconut milk (thinner portion) and curry leaves. Continue slow-simmering for an additional 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. 

8. Season the curry with salt to taste, and pour the remaining coconut milk (thin and thick) for added richness. Let the curry cook for an additional 2-3 minutes.

9. Remove the pan from heat, and let the curry rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the flavors to settle and ensures the fish is perfectly cooked.
